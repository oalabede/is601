In 1993, Mosaic was not the first browser that internet had seen, but it was a revolutionary one. It gave the internet the capability of multimedia which something that a lot of people did not think was possible. With Mosaic, users were able to browse for image, audio, and videos. It was the essence of user friendly, it made the internet a place of entertainment, and a place to be.

     After Mosaic, Marc Andreessen went to James, H. clark for financial support, and together they created a company called [Netscape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape).The company was very successful when it first launched. JavaScript, one of the widely used programming languages, full of libraries today was created by a developer from Netsape. Although the company was widely recognized for its amazing and life changing broswer, there was one guy, who was watching very closely. A guy who loves competion and would do anything to always be on the wining side; his name is [Bill Gates](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Gates).

It also allowed users to browse for information. From that time on, everyone knew it would be the [First Browser War]().

###  Sidebar Content 
-   The browser war was escalated when Mark Andreesen called Microsoft engineers, "a set of poorly debugged devise drivers" in an article. The statement shifted everyone's focus at Microsoft to "crush Netscape by any means necessary", creating internet explorer with much better versions in comparison to Netscape Navigator [Internet Explorer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer) and made it free for users. Microsoft also instructed the PC manufacturers to not install Netscape browser or else, they would lose their Windows license, thereby monopolizing the internet.
