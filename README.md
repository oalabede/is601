In 1993, Mosaic was not the first browser that internet had seen, but it was a revolutionary one. It gave the internet the capability of multimedia which something that a lot of people did not think was possible. With Mosaic, users were able to browse for image, audio, and videos. It made the internet a place of entertainment, and a place to be.

     After Mosaic, Marc Andreessen went to James, H. clark for financial support, and together they created a company called [Netscape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape).The company was very successful when it first launched. JavaScript, One of the widely used programming languages with full of libraries today was created by a developer from Netsape. Although the company was widely recognized for its amazing and life changing broswer, there was one guy, who was watching very closely. A guy who loves competion and would do anything to always be on the wining side; his name is [Bill Gates](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Gates).
